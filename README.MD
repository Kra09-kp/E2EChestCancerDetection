# 🩺 E2E Chest Cancer Detection

Welcome to the **E2E Chest Cancer Detection** repository!  
This project delivers an end-to-end solution for detecting chest cancer from medical images using the power of deep learning and modern data science workflows.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Chest cancer, including lung and other thoracic malignancies, remains one of the most critical health challenges worldwide. Early and accurate detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This repository provides a robust, automated pipeline for:

- **Preprocessing medical images**  
- **Building and training deep learning models**  
- **Evaluating model performance**  
- **Making predictions on new data**  
- **Visualizing results for interpretability**

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **End-to-End Pipeline**: From data preprocessing to prediction deployment.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Leverages state-of-the-art architectures (e.g., CNNs, transfer learning).
- **User-Friendly**: Clear, modular code and well-documented notebooks.
- **Visualization Tools**: Interpret model predictions with explainable AI techniques.
- **Customizable**: Easy to adapt for different datasets or similar medical imaging tasks.
